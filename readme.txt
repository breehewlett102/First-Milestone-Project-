For our First Milestone Project, I decided to make a game of 'Tic Tac Toe'!

Below, there are instructions on how to properly play this game! If you already know how, then go ahead and play, but if not, here you go!:

First, you will decided between you and the other player who is 'X' and who is 'O'. 
Once this is decided, whoever is 'X' will go first. You place down your symbol whereever you want it on the chart, and then after 'X' goes, then 'O' goes.
This will continue for up to 9 times, and whoever gets three in a row first is the winner!

Enjoy!
